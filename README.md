- 👋 Hi, I’m Luke
- 👀 I’m interested in data, modeling, machine learning, and Python programming. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, machine learning, reinforcement learning, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Scikit Learn. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Go Code Colorado at the moment (on the Regis University team).  I'm interested in projects that benefit the greater good, get me out of my comfort zone, and teach me important data skills.
